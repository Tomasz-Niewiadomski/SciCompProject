# RegEx matching/searching algorithms

## The plan:
1. Find different regex searching algorithms
2. Implement the viable ones
3. Confront them with public libraries/softwares
4. ???
5. Money I guess?

## What have we done:
### Paolo
The naive class is somewhat done, the recursive and dynamical programming algorithms work for searching (i.e. matching with .* ) but not matching, which is a bit odd.

## What we are doing atm:

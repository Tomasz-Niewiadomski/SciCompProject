# RegEx matching/searching algorithms

## The current plan:
Let's split the project into phases:

1. NFA engine - searches for pattern when given a graph ✅
3. Parse regex into an AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) - breaks down a regular expression into categories ✅
4. Build NFA from regex - "builds a graph" from a given regular expression  ✅
5. Tie it all together - given a regular expression, builds the graph and searches for pattern with the engine ✅
6. Adding the 'dot' feature and possibly ranges. ✅
7. Benchmark time ✅ 👨🏻‍🇹🇷
8. Writing the report & preparing presentation 👩🏻‍🇹🇷

## What have we done:
### Paolo 🇮🇹

It's done yayy

- Maybe we nedd to add support for the ```.``` character, so that we could use ```.*anything.*``` which would search through all the text?

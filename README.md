# RegEx matching/searching algorithms

## The current plan:
1. Write an engine
2. Write a parser
3. Use them to search/match
4. Testing and benchmarking (this phase might be very short depending on the time we have)
5. ???
6. Money I guess?

## What have we done:
### Paolo
The naive class is somewhat done, the recursive and dynamical programming algorithms work for searching (i.e. matching with .* ) but not matching, which is a bit odd.
I uploaded a very simple test file + a library.txt text
